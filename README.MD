*What items are worth buying this faire? Sigh*... - Does that sound familiar? If yes, you've come to the right place! Read on...

**DarkmoonTicketTooltip** displays the amount of Darkmoon Prize tickets awarded in the tooltip quest items that can be turned in at the Faire, along with some other information that might be useful.

 If you have several alts and are interested in getting the most bang for your buck, you can identify the most efficient items to buy and glance over all the overpriced stuff that the price-gougers inevitably put up when the fare comes around.

 Essentially, DTT helps you decide which of the DMF quest items you should buy (and when), hopefully making your monthly shopping for them much less painful. No more overspending on the least-worthwhile items or re-calculating prices every time the market changes. Thank goodness!

## Features
 The addon is fairly lightweight at this time. Here is what it does:
 
 * Adds a few lines to the tooltip of items that can be redeemed for Darkmoon Prize Tickets at the Darkmoon Faire
 * Lets you know whether or not the quest has been completed already
 * Shows how many tickets you will get if you turn in any of the quest items
 * Calculates the price per ticket for each item, using pricing data provided by [TradeSkillMaster_AuctionDB](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/tradeskillmaster_auctiondb) (needs to be installed for this to show)
 
 ## How to use
 
 In a nutshell:
 
 1. Install the addon
 2. Hover over one of the items whenever you want the info
 3. ???
 4. Profit!
 
 There are no slash commands, fancy configuration interfaces, or spammy chat messages.

## Localisation
A proper localisation system is implemented, but many locales aren't fully translated (yet). If you can help out, it will be appreciated!
